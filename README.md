## Inspiration
> Today (10-07-2020) i was searching for website which (NMMC ) has published for tracking bed availability for covid 19 patient.  
After browsing for while i end up on http://nmmccovid19.in/ 
As a common man i felt the website to be too complex for lazy man to under
First thing i got confuse on what the hell is CCC ? or DCH ? or DCHC
On Landing page you are showing me GRAPH. whats next call for action?
So I decided to built this website.
